## **Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)**

## **0.0 Introduction**

The Technology Transformation Services has developed this Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) to evaluate contractor actions while implementing the Performance Work Statement (PWS). It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method for monitoring contractor performance for each listed objective on the Performance Requirements Summary in the purchase order. It also provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish.

## **1.0 Standard**

The contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the order. The contractor shall perform all work required in a satisfactory manner in accordance with the requirements of the PWS. The contracting officer’s representative (COR) shall notify the contracting officer for appropriate action if it is likely that the contractor will not achieve successful final delivery of the software code in accordance with the performance objectives and acceptable quality levels identified below.

## **2.0 The Contracting Officer**

The contracting officer (CO) is responsible for monitoring contract compliance, contract administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences between the observations documented by the COR and the contractor. The CO will designate a COR as the government authority for performance management. The number of additional representatives serving as technical inspectors depends on the complexity of the services measured, as well as the contractor’s performance, and must be identified and designated by the CO.

## **3.0 The Contracting Officer’s Representative**

The contracting officer’s representative (COR) is designated in writing by the CO to act as their authorized representative to assist in administering a contract. COR limitations are contained in the written appointment letter. The COR is responsible for technical administration of the project and ensures proper government surveillance of the contractor’s performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the government’s behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect contract price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the CO for action. The COR will have the responsibility for documenting the inspection and evaluation of the contractor’s work performance. Government surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service relating to the contract.

## **4.0 Performance Requirements Summary**

The COR will evaluate the performance objectives through surveillance as reflected below by reviews and acceptance of work products and services. As indicated, the COR will assess progress towards the final delivered software code. Note that the performance requirements listed below are required for the final deliverable. However, the sprints and incremental delivery of code will be assessed by the government to ensure that the contractor is on a path to successful final delivery.
