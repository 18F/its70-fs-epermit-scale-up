**Request for Information from Schedule 70 Vendors:**

The Forest Service and 18F Acquisition team plan to release a solicitation on GSA Schedule 70 in a few months that will be the fourth contract in the Forest Service’s modular procurement strategy to build an online permitting system. The [<span class="underline">first 3 procurements</span>](https://github.com/18F/fs-online-permitting/wiki#project-code-repositories-sites-and-rfqs) used 18F’s agile Blanket Purchase Agreement. We’re now investigating whether we can get enhanced competition by setting the next procurement aside for small businesses on GSA's [Schedule 70](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/it-schedule-70).

Like all of the buys that 18F supports with our federal and state partners, we're looking for vendor teams that focus on human-centered design, modern software development techniques, and incremental delivery of products using open source code. If this project is something that your company would be interested in following, we’ve got two requests that we don’t think should take too much of your time:

**Request \#1:**

Please provide a bit more information about your company by responding to this [short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdC7r27gVmMImg-NVOVonkVpi4b4W-AaLUCgLtsrt_DoDBdkA/viewform?usp=sf_link). This information will help us know whether your company would be interested in working with us. This will also give us the chance to add to the broader and ongoing market research that 18F conducts to identify vendors that would fit well with our goal of delivering great software products to our end users. Please respond by \[date\]

**Request \#2:**

This is even more important. We’d welcome your feedback on our [draft RFQ](/solicitation-documents/RFQ.md). Like most everything that 18F does, we are intentionally transparent and hope that you will provide your comments publicly. We’ve set up an [Issues](https://github.com/18F/its70-fs-epermit-scale-up/issues) file in our GitHub repo that is meant to capture and respond to any feedback that the vendor community has about our documentation and the acquisition process we intend to follow. Keep in mind that this is a draft document, so we fully intend to make changes if we think it will lead to better outcomes for our acquisition.

We’ll keep this GitHub repository updated as we make progress towards releasing a final RFP. Thanks very much for your time, and we look forward to hearing from you about this important project\!
